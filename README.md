#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing, and maintaining software.
Importance:
Reliability: It ensures software performs as expected without bias, especially for critical applications like healthcare and finance.
Efficiency: It helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
Scalability and Flexibility: It ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
Security: It implements protection practices like authentication, authorization, and encryption to secure users' information.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Complexity: Early software engineering focused on managing increasingly complex systems using methods like modular and structured programming to break down complex problems into simpler parts.
Mastering Process: Standardization and formalization of software development processes led to various life cycle models (e.g., Waterfall, Agile) that helped ensure projects were completed on time and within budget.
Mastering Machine: Advances in hardware and software, including more sophisticated programming languages and operating systems, enabled more efficient and powerful computing, leveraging hardware advancements for better software systems.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define the project's objectives, goals, and scope.
Requirement Analysis: Gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders and end-users.
Design: Create the software architecture and design.
Coding: Write the actual code based on design documents.
Testing: Verify and validate the software to ensure it meets requirements and is free of defects.
Deployment: Release the software to the production environment.
Maintenance: Update, fix bugs, and enhance the software to ensure it remains functional and relevant.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:
Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.
Low flexibility; changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile Methodology:
Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints).
High flexibility; adapts to changing requirements.
Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:
Developing applications, programs, and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices when developing software.
Reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer:
Collaborating with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
Creating development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow.
Confirming that the software meets the requirements before deployment.
Analyzing the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make it more efficient.
Developing and executing automation scripts using open source tools.

Project Manager:
Assembling and leading the software development team.
Discussing the project and its requirements with the client and software developers.
Creating a blueprint for the project.
Tracking and communicating information regarding project milestones.
Delivering the complete software to the client and regularly checking its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates software creation by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Features intelligent tools for automatically writing or editing source code, making it more readable.
Provides visual cues and instant feedback for syntax errors.
Suggests code completion while typing.
Increases programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks.
Compiles code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand (e.g., just-in-time compiling).
Automates unit tests and allows developers to run local tests.
Enables debugging by stepping through code line by line and highlighting bugs in real time.

Version Control Systems (VCS)are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
Enables collaboration among multiple developers without conflicts.
Records detailed history of changes for easy analysis.
Supports branching and merging for new features.
Allows error recovery by reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Technological Advancement: Staying current with rapid advancements.
Solution: Adopt continuous learning practices and agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends and keep skills sharp.

Time Constraints: Working under tight deadlines in a demanding field.
Solution: Adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints.

Limited Infrastructure: Limited high-performance tools, computing platforms, and inefficient data storage architectures.
Solution: Rely heavily on robust infrastructure to perform jobs effectively.

Changing Software Requirements: Difficulties in designing and developing solutions that meet evolving user needs.
Solution: Adopt agile development for iterative progress and adaptability, and use modular design for flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.

Software Security: Programming secure software is challenging.
Solution: Research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider, and third-party threats.

Software Accessibility and Usability: Overly complex software can confuse users.
Solution: Use scalable architecture and emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering refers to the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved User Experience: Makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. Helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased Flexibility: A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
Developer Control: Gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about the weather.
Improved Prompt: Provide the current weather conditions in Kisumu, Kenya, including temperature, humidity, and any precipitation.
Explanation:
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies the location (Kisumu, Kenya) and the specific weather details (temperature, humidity, and precipitation) that are being requested.
Specificity: The improved prompt leaves no room for ambiguity, making it clear exactly what information is needed.
Conciseness: The improved prompt is concise, ensuring that only relevant details are included and making it easy for the AI to understand and respond accurately.
